## Vision

PAI-OpenCode brings the power of PAI (Personal AI Infrastructure) to the OpenCode platform. This is a systematic, documented migration that validates PAI 2.0's platform independence promise while creating a shareable foundation for the community. We're not just porting code—we're proving that sophisticated AI scaffolding can transcend any single platform.

---

## What is PAI?

[PAI (Personal AI Infrastructure)](https://github.com/danielmiessler/PAI) is an open-source scaffolding system created by Daniel Miessler for building AI-powered personal assistants. PAI extends AI coding environments with sophisticated capabilities that vanilla installations lack.

### PAI 2.0 Core Concepts

**Packs** - Self-contained bundles of functionality distributed as single markdown files. Each pack contains complete code, configuration, and documentation needed to add capabilities to your AI assistant.

**Skills** - Domain expertise packages that auto-activate based on natural language triggers. Skills use progressive disclosure to load only what's needed, dramatically reducing token usage.

**Agents** - Specialized AI personalities (engineer, researcher, architect, designer, pentester) with unique voices and capabilities that can be delegated tasks and work in parallel.

**Two Loops Pattern** - PAI's architectural philosophy: an Outer Loop (Current → Desired state) combined with an Inner Loop (7-phase execution: Plan → Specify → Clarify → Apply → Validate → Archive → Release).

### Why PAI Matters

PAI transforms AI coding assistants from reactive chat interfaces into proactive, context-aware systems with memory, specialized expertise, and systematic workflows. It's the difference between talking to a chatbot and collaborating with a team of specialized experts who understand your context, maintain continuity across sessions, and follow disciplined development practices.

## Why This Port?

**The Platform Reality:** Daniel's PAI 2.0 was initially built for Claude Code. While PAI promises platform independence through its pack-and-bundle architecture, the actual migration to OpenCode requires significant adaptation:

- **Different Extension Systems**: Claude Code uses hooks (JSON configuration), OpenCode uses plugins (TypeScript modules)
- **Different Loading Mechanisms**: Claude Code lacks native lazy loading (requiring workarounds), OpenCode supports it natively
- **Different Session Management**: Each platform stores session data differently
- **Different API Patterns**: Agent delegation, tool execution, and event handling vary between platforms

**The Goal:** This port validates PAI 2.0's portability claims while documenting every adaptation required. We're creating a reusable blueprint for migrating PAI to any platform—proving the architecture is sound and the methodology works.

**The Community Benefit:** By documenting this migration thoroughly, we enable others to:
- Migrate PAI to OpenCode following our tested path
- Port PAI to other platforms (Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) using our lessons learned
- Understand the differences between platforms when building portable AI systems
- Contribute improvements back to the ecosystem

## Scope

### What's IN Scope (v1.0)

This project is a **pure vanilla PAI 2.0 port** to OpenCode. We include:

✅ **All PAI 2.0 Core Components:**
- 8 kai-* packs (kai-core-install, kai-hook-system, etc.)
- Skills system with progressive disclosure
- Agent delegation (intern, engineer, architect, designer, pentester)
- COMPLETE History system (OpenCode sessions + PAI knowledge layer: learnings/, research/, decisions/, ideas/, projects/)
- Hooks adapted as OpenCode plugins (6 core plugin equivalents)
- Constitutional framework and Two Loops architecture
- Voice system (if part of vanilla PAI 2.0)

✅ **Platform Adaptation Layer:**
- Converter tool for importing PAI updates
- Skill format translation for OpenCode lazy loading
- Hook → Plugin adaptation
- Documentation for community use

### What's OUT of Scope (v1.0)

This is **NOT a fork with modifications**. We exclude:

❌ **Personal Customizations:**
- User-specific identity layers (TELOS, Ideology)
- Custom business contexts
- Personal workflow adaptations
- Private tools and extensions

❌ **Platform-Specific Experiments:**
- Untested feature additions
- Performance optimizations beyond vanilla
- New capabilities not in PAI 2.0

### The Vanilla Principle

**v1.0 = Pure PAI 2.0 on OpenCode.** Nothing more, nothing less.

This ensures:
1. The port is a faithful reference implementation
2. Others can trust it as a starting point
3. Platform differences are clearly isolated
4. Personal extensions can be built on top (separately)

**After v1.0:** Personal customizations and extensions live in separate private projects, not in this public repository.

## Technical Approach

PAI-OpenCode makes **6 key technical decisions** documented in our Constitution:

| Decision | Approach | Rationale |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| **Configuration** | Clean Break + Converter | Maintain import capability, not backwards compatibility |
| **Agent Delegation** | Hybrid (Task API + Subagents) | PAI packs use Task tool, simple tasks use OpenCode native |
| **Skills Loading** | LazyLoad Translation | OpenCode supports native lazy loading (92.5% token reduction) |
| **Hook System** | DEFERRED (needs research) | Plugins fundamentally different from hooks—requires investigation |
| **History System** | OpenCode Sessions (v1.0) | Use native session storage for public port |
| **Directory Structure** | Clean `.opencode/` | Project-level config, not global, with converter for PAI updates |

**Guiding Principle:** *Import capability over backwards compatibility.* We build on OpenCode natively while maintaining the ability to import PAI 2.0 updates via our converter tool.

**Full Technical Decisions:** See [constitution.md](constitution.md) Section IX for detailed rationale.

```

**Current Status:** Foundation complete (workspace + git + research). Installation workflow in development.

### Converter Quick Start

The PAI→OpenCode converter tool translates PAI 2.x structure to OpenCode format automatically:

```bash
# Convert PAI 2.x to OpenCode format
bun run tools/pai-to-opencode-converter.ts --source ~/.claude --target .opencode

# Preview changes first (recommended)
bun run tools/pai-to-opencode-converter.ts --dry-run --verbose

# See all options
bun run tools/pai-to-opencode-converter.ts --help
```

**Key Features:**
- Automatic structure translation (skills/, hooks/, config/)
- Conflict detection and backup creation
- Dry-run mode for safe previewing
- Verbose logging for transparency
- Preserves existing OpenCode files

## What's Next?

**v0.7.0 Complete!** Plugin Adapter with all 4 tests passing:

- ✅ Plugin Load - Unified plugin loads correctly
- ✅ Context Injection - CORE skill injected at session start
- ✅ Security Blocking - Dangerous commands blocked (e.g., `rm -rf ../`)
- ✅ Logging - All events logged to `/tmp/pai-opencode-debug.log`

**Key Technical Discoveries:**
```typescript
// OpenCode API quirk: Args are in OUTPUT, not input!
"tool.execute.before": async (input, output) => {
  const command = output.args.command; // ← NOT input.args!
  if (dangerous(command)) {
    throw new Error("Blocked!"); // ← This stops execution
  }
}
```

**Plugin Architecture:**
```
.opencode/plugin/
├── pai-unified.ts          ← Single unified plugin
├── handlers/
│   ├── context-loader.ts   ← CORE skill injection
│   └── security-validator.ts ← Block dangerous commands
├── adapters/types.ts       ← Shared TypeScript types
└── lib/file-logger.ts      ← TUI-safe logging
```

**Upcoming Milestones:**
- **v0.9** - Integration Testing + Documentation ⚠️ NEXT
- **v1.0** - PUBLIC RELEASE (Community-ready vanilla PAI 2.3)

**Future (Post v1.0):**
- Ollama integration for local models
- Voice system
- Observability dashboard
