## What is this?

PAI-OpenCode is the complete port of **Daniel Miessler's Personal AI Infrastructure (PAI)** to **OpenCode** — an open-source, provider-agnostic AI coding assistant.

![Architecture Overview](docs/images/architecture-overview.png)

**PAI** is a scaffolding system that makes AI assistants work better for *you*. It's not about which model you use — it's about the infrastructure around it:

- **Skills** — Modular capabilities (code review, security testing, research, design)
- **Agents** — Dynamic multi-agent orchestration
- **Memory** — Session history, project context, learning loops
- **Plugins** — Lifecycle automation (session init, security validation, observability)

**OpenCode** is an open-source alternative to Claude Code that supports 75+ AI providers — from Anthropic and OpenAI to Google, AWS Bedrock, Ollama, and beyond.

**PAI-OpenCode** = The best of both worlds.

## Why PAI-OpenCode?

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| **PAI was built for Claude Code** (Anthropic only) | PAI-OpenCode works with **any AI provider** |
| **Vendor lock-in** limits your options | Switch providers freely while keeping your infrastructure |
| **Generic AI assistants** don't know your workflow | PAI's skills, memory, and plugins personalize to *your* needs |
| **One-shot interactions** lose context | PAI's memory system builds knowledge over time |

**The scaffolding is more important than the model.** PAI-OpenCode gives you:

✅ Provider freedom (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, Llama, etc.)
✅ Full PAI infrastructure (skills, agents, memory, plugins)
✅ Real-time session sharing (OpenCode feature)
✅ Terminal + Desktop + Web clients
✅ Community-driven, open-source foundation

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone PAI-OpenCode
git clone https://github.com/Steffen025/pai-opencode.git
cd pai-opencode

# 2. Run the Installation Wizard
bun run .opencode/PAIOpenCodeWizard.ts

# 3. Start OpenCode
opencode
```

The wizard will ask you to:
- Choose your AI provider (8 options: Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Groq, AWS Bedrock, Azure, ZEN free, Ollama)
- Set your name and timezone
- Name your AI assistant

**Takes ~2 minutes** and creates all necessary configuration files.

---

## Deep Personalization (Recommended)

After running the wizard, start OpenCode and paste this prompt for full personalization:

```
Let's do the onboarding. Guide me through setting up my personal context -
my name, my goals, my values, and how I want you to behave. Create the TELOS
and identity files that make this AI mine.
```

This **10-15 minute** interactive session will configure your complete TELOS framework:

| What Gets Created | Purpose |
|-------------------|---------|
| **Mission & Goals** | Your life purposes and specific objectives |
| **Challenges & Strategies** | What's blocking you and how to overcome it |
| **Values & Beliefs** | Core principles that guide decisions |
| **Narratives** | Your key talking points and messages |
| **Tech Preferences** | Languages, frameworks, tools you prefer |

**Why TELOS matters:** PAI becomes exponentially more useful when it knows your context. Generic AI gives generic advice. PAI with TELOS gives *you-specific* guidance.
