## What is this?

PAI-OpenCode is the complete port of **Daniel Miessler's Personal AI Infrastructure (PAI)** to **OpenCode** — an open-source, provider-agnostic AI coding assistant.

![Architecture Overview](docs/images/architecture-overview.png)

**PAI** is a scaffolding system that makes AI assistants work better for *you*. It's not about which model you use — it's about the infrastructure around it:

- **Skills** — Modular capabilities (code review, security testing, research, design)
- **Agents** — Dynamic multi-agent orchestration
- **Memory** — Session history, project context, learning loops
- **Plugins** — Lifecycle automation (session init, security validation, observability)

**OpenCode** is an open-source alternative to Claude Code that supports 75+ AI providers — from Anthropic and OpenAI to Google, AWS Bedrock, Ollama, and beyond.

**PAI-OpenCode** = The best of both worlds.

---

## Why PAI-OpenCode?

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| **PAI was built for Claude Code** (Anthropic only) | PAI-OpenCode works with **any AI provider** |
| **Vendor lock-in** limits your options | Switch providers freely while keeping your infrastructure |
| **Generic AI assistants** don't know your workflow | PAI's skills, memory, and plugins personalize to *your* needs |
| **One-shot interactions** lose context | PAI's memory system builds knowledge over time |

**The scaffolding is more important than the model.** PAI-OpenCode gives you:

✅ Provider freedom (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, Llama, etc.)
✅ Full PAI infrastructure (skills, agents, memory, plugins)
✅ Real-time session sharing (OpenCode feature)
✅ Terminal + Desktop + Web clients
✅ Community-driven, open-source foundation

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone PAI-OpenCode
git clone https://github.com/Steffen025/pai-opencode.git
cd pai-opencode

# 2. Run the Installation Wizard
bun run .opencode/PAIOpenCodeWizard.ts

# 3. Start OpenCode
opencode
```

The wizard will ask you to:
- Choose your AI provider (8 options: Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Groq, AWS Bedrock, Azure, ZEN free, Ollama)
- Set your name and timezone
- Name your AI assistant

**Takes ~2 minutes** and creates all necessary configuration files.

---

## Deep Personalization (Recommended)

After running the wizard, start OpenCode and paste this prompt for full personalization:

```
Let's do the onboarding. Guide me through setting up my personal context -
my name, my goals, my values, and how I want you to behave. Create the TELOS
and identity files that make this AI mine.
```

This **10-15 minute** interactive session will configure your complete TELOS framework:

| What Gets Created | Purpose |
|-------------------|---------|
| **Mission & Goals** | Your life purposes and specific objectives |
| **Challenges & Strategies** | What's blocking you and how to overcome it |
| **Values & Beliefs** | Core principles that guide decisions |
| **Narratives** | Your key talking points and messages |
| **Tech Preferences** | Languages, frameworks, tools you prefer |

**Why TELOS matters:** PAI becomes exponentially more useful when it knows your context. Generic AI gives generic advice. PAI with TELOS gives *you-specific* guidance.

## Cost-Aware Research System

PAI-OpenCode includes a **3-tier research system** that optimizes for both quality and cost:

| Tier | Workflow | Agents | Cost | Trigger |
|------|----------|--------|------|---------|
| **Quick** (DEFAULT) | `QuickResearch` | 1 Claude | **$0 FREE** | "research X" |
| **Standard** | `StandardResearch` | 3 (Claude + Gemini + Perplexity) | ~$0.01 | "standard research" |
| **Extensive** | `ExtensiveResearch` | 4-5 providers | ~$0.10-0.50 | "extensive research" |

### Why This Matters

**Quick Research is FREE** — ClaudeResearcher uses Claude WebSearch, which is included in your Anthropic subscription. No API keys needed, no extra cost.

**Standard Research** adds multi-perspective coverage with Gemini and Perplexity for ~$0.01 per query.

**Extensive Research** requires explicit confirmation before running (cost gate) to prevent unexpected charges.

### Available Research Agents

| Agent | Model | Specialty | Cost |
|-------|-------|-----------|------|
| `ClaudeResearcher` | claude-sonnet-4-5 | Academic depth, scholarly synthesis | **FREE** |
| `GeminiResearcher` | gemini-1.5-pro | Multi-perspective analysis | ~$0.01 |
| `GrokResearcher` | grok-4-1-fast | Contrarian, social media, X access | ~$0.01 |
| `PerplexityResearcher` | sonar | Real-time news, breaking events | ~$0.01 |
| `PerplexityProResearcher` | sonar-pro | Deep investigation, extensive | ~$0.05 |
| `CodexResearcher` | gpt-4o | Technical, TypeScript-focused | ~$0.03 |

### Setup

Copy `.opencode/.env.example` to `.opencode/.env` and add your API keys:

```bash
cp .opencode/.env.example .opencode/.env
# Edit .env with your keys
```

**Required for Standard/Extensive only:**
- `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` — $5/month includes sonar
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY` — Free tier available
- `XAI_API_KEY` — Very cheap (~$0.20/1M tokens)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` — For CodexResearcher

## Architecture

PAI-OpenCode's design is documented through **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**—formal documents explaining *why* we made specific choices during the port from Claude Code to OpenCode.

| ADR | Decision | Why It Matters |
|-----|----------|----------------|
| [ADR-001](docs/architecture/adr/ADR-001-hooks-to-plugins-architecture.md) | Hooks → Plugins | OpenCode uses in-process plugins, not subprocess hooks |
| [ADR-002](docs/architecture/adr/ADR-002-directory-structure-claude-to-opencode.md) | `.claude/` → `.opencode/` | Platform directory convention |
| [ADR-003](docs/architecture/adr/ADR-003-skills-system-unchanged.md) | Skills System Unchanged | Preserves upstream PAI compatibility |
| [ADR-004](docs/architecture/adr/ADR-004-plugin-logging-file-based.md) | File-Based Logging | Prevents TUI corruption from console.log |
| [ADR-005](docs/architecture/adr/ADR-005-configuration-dual-file-approach.md) | Dual Config Files | PAI settings.json + OpenCode opencode.json |
| [ADR-006](docs/architecture/adr/ADR-006-security-validation-preservation.md) | Security Patterns Preserved | Critical security validation unchanged |
| [ADR-007](docs/architecture/adr/ADR-007-memory-system-structure-preserved.md) | Memory Structure Preserved | File-based MEMORY/ system unchanged |

**Key Principles:**
- **Preserve PAI's design** where possible
- **Adapt to OpenCode** where necessary
- **Document every change** in ADRs
