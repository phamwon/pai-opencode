# PAI-OpenCode

## For OpenCode

When you start in this directory, determine the installation state:

### If settings.json exists and is configured:
This is an established PAI installation. Read and follow the CORE skill:
```
read skills/CORE/SKILL.md
```

### If this is a fresh installation:
1. The default `settings.json` works out of the box
2. Edit settings with your preferences if desired
3. Start using PAI!

## For Humans

Welcome to PAI-OpenCode v1.0!

1. **Just start**: `opencode` - everything works with defaults
2. **Customize**: Edit `settings.json` for identity and preferences
3. **Learn more**: Read `skills/CORE/SKILL.md`

For full documentation, see the README.md in the repository root.
