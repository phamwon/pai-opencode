# Onboarding Workflow

**Trigger:** "onboarding", "personalize", "setup assistant", "configure identity", "first time setup"

## Purpose

**Stage 2 of PAI-OpenCode Setup** — Deep personalization after the Installation Wizard.

The `PAIOpenCodeWizard.ts` (Stage 1) sets up the basic configuration: provider, name, AI name, timezone. This workflow (Stage 2) goes deeper into your TELOS framework: mission, goals, values, beliefs, challenges.

**Why two stages?**
- Stage 1 (Wizard): Technical setup, ~2 minutes, runs BEFORE OpenCode
- Stage 2 (This): Deep personalization, 10-15 minutes, runs INSIDE OpenCode

This workflow creates the personal context files that make PAI truly yours.

## What Gets Configured

| Component | File | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| **TELOS** | `skills/PAI/USER/TELOS.md` | Your mission, goals, values, challenges |
| **Identity** | `skills/PAI/USER/DAIDENTITY.md` | AI name, personality, voice preferences |
| **Contacts** | `skills/PAI/USER/Contacts.md` | Important people in your life/work |
| **Stack** | `skills/PAI/USER/CoreStack.md` | Technology preferences |
| **Steering Rules** | `skills/PAI/USER/AISTEERINGRULES.md` | Custom AI behavior rules |

## Execution

### Phase 1: Welcome & Context

Start with:

```
Welcome to PAI-OpenCode personalization!

I'm going to ask you a series of questions to make this AI truly yours.
This usually takes 10-15 minutes and creates your personal context files.

You can skip any question by pressing Enter, and update these files anytime.
