## 0. PAI 2.0 Architecture (NEW - From Comprehensive Research)

### Two Loops Pattern (Core Methodology)

PAI 2.0 uses a **Two Loops** cognitive architecture:

**Outer Loop (Meta-Cognition):**
```
Current State Assessment → Gap Analysis → Desired State Definition
```

**Inner Loop (7 Phases):**
```
OBSERVE → THINK → PLAN → BUILD → EXECUTE → VERIFY → LEARN
```

This pattern applies to every task, from simple queries to complex multi-session projects.

### 15 Founding Principles

1. **Scaffolding > Model** - Architecture matters more than underlying LLM
2. **Code before Prompts** - TypeScript handles logic, prompts orchestrate
3. **Spec/Test/Evals First** - Never build before specifications
4. **UNIX Philosophy** - Each tool does one thing well
5. **CLI-first** - Build deterministic CLIs, wrap with AI
6. **Identity = Behavior** - Who the AI is shapes what it does
7. **Progressive Disclosure** - Load context just-in-time
8. **Skills as Containers** - Self-contained expertise packages
9. **History is Memory** - Automatic documentation creates learning
10. **Voice is Presence** - TTS creates emotional connection
11. **Delegation by Design** - Use specialized agents
12. **Security by Default** - Validate all tool executions
13. **Platform Agnostic** - Work across Claude Code, OpenCode, Cursor
14. **Pack Portability** - Packs are installation units
15. **Human in the Loop** - AI augments, human decides

### Four Primitives (PAI 2.0 Building Blocks)

| Primitive | Purpose | Location |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Pack** | Self-contained upgrade packages | `Packs/` directory |
| **Bundle** | Multiple related packs | `Packs/Bundles/` |
| **Agent** | Specialized AI personalities | `Packs/Agents/` or `.opencode/agents/` |
| **Skill** | Domain expertise modules | Defined within packs |

### The 8 Core Packs (kai-*)

| Pack | Purpose | Dependencies |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `kai-core-install` | Foundation, AGENTS.md, directory structure | None (install first) |
| `kai-hook-system` | Event-driven hooks (8 types) | kai-core-install |
| `kai-history-system` | Sessions, learnings, decisions | kai-core-install, kai-hook-system |
| `kai-voice-system` | TTS feedback via ElevenLabs | kai-hook-system |
| `kai-art-skill` | Image generation via Replicate | kai-core-install |
| `kai-agents-skill` | Specialized AI personalities | kai-core-install |
| `kai-observability-server` | Real-time WebSocket dashboard | kai-hook-system |
| `kai-prompting-skill` | Prompt engineering expertise | kai-core-install |

### Progressive Disclosure (3 Tiers) - 92.5% Token Reduction

| Tier | Content | Token Cost | When Loaded |
|------|---------|------------|-------------|
| **Tier 1** | `description:` in YAML frontmatter | ~50 tokens | Always (system prompt) |
| **Tier 2** | SKILL.md body content | ~250 tokens | On skill activation |
| **Tier 3** | Reference files in `docs/`, `workflows/` | Variable | Just-in-time |

**Result:** 4000 tokens → 300 tokens average = **92.5% reduction**

### Hook System v2.0 (Claude Code - 8 Events)

| Hook | When Fired | Can Block | Use Case |
|------|------------|-----------|----------|
| `PreToolUse` | Before tool execution | YES (exit 2) | Security validation |
| `PostToolUse` | After tool execution | NO | Logging, side effects |
| `Stop` | When assistant stops | NO | Voice feedback |
| `SubagentStop` | When subagent completes | NO | Agent tracking |
| `SessionStart` | Session begins | NO | Context loading |
| `SessionEnd` | Session ends | NO | Summary generation |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | User sends message | NO | Input processing |
| `PreCompact` | Before context compaction | NO | Memory preservation |

**Exit Code Semantics:**
- 0 = Success/Allow
- 1 = Non-blocking error (log and continue)
- 2 = Block (PreToolUse only - prevents tool execution)

### PAIMM (PAI Maturity Model)

| Level | Name | Characteristics |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| 0 | Chatbots | Basic Q&A |
| 1 | Basic | Simple tool use |
| 2 | Advanced | Multi-tool workflows |
| 3 | Agentic | Autonomous task completion |
| 4 | PAI L1 | Personal context aware |
| 5 | PAI L2 | Cross-session memory |
| 6 | PAI L3 | Proactive assistance |
| 7 | Superhuman | Exceeds human capability in domain |
| 8 | AS2 | Advanced Superhuman Level 2 |
| 9 | AS3 | Advanced Superhuman Level 3 |

## 1. Executive Summary

OpenCode is a **local-first, CLI-based AI coding agent platform** with comprehensive infrastructure for agents, tools, plugins, and multi-provider LLM support. It offers native solutions to many challenges PAI currently solves with custom code, but requires significant architectural adaptation for compatibility with PAI's existing systems.

### Key Takeaways for Jeremy 2.0

1. **Configuration-driven architecture** - OpenCode uses JSON/JSONC configuration with hierarchical merging (global → project → custom), similar to PAI but different schema
2. **Native plugin system** - Event-based hooks with NPM distribution capability vs. PAI's TypeScript hooks
3. **Built-in systems** - Formatters, LSP, permissions, and tools reduce need for custom implementations
4. **Agent architecture** - Primary/subagent distinction requires mapping to PAI's Task-based delegation
5. **Skills as first-class citizens** - Native `skill` tool with lazy loading vs. PAI's auto-loading triggers

### Overall Migration Complexity: **HIGH**

**Rationale:** While OpenCode offers many compatible features, fundamental architectural differences (configuration format, agent system, hook infrastructure, skills loading) require substantial adaptation work. Estimated 18-26 days minimum for basic compatibility, with ongoing integration work for full feature parity.

## 3. Migration Impact Analysis

### What Works Out of Box

✅ **Fully Compatible (0% adaptation)**

1. **Multi-provider LLM support** - 75+ providers vs PAI's configured set
2. **Environment variable substitution** - Both support `{env:VAR}` syntax
3. **File-based configuration** - Both use hierarchical merging
4. **Markdown agent definitions** - Format is similar enough
5. **Git integration** - Standard git operations work
6. **LSP capabilities** - OpenCode's built-in surpasses PAI custom
7. **Code formatting** - OpenCode native system replaces custom needs
8. **Terminal UI** - Both CLI-first architectures

### What Needs Adaptation

⚠️ **Requires Code Changes (20-50% refactor)**

| Component | Effort | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Configuration Files** | 3-5 days | Convert `.claude/settings.json` schema to `opencode.json` format. Create migration script. |
| **File Path References** | 2-3 days | Update all `.claude/` → `.opencode/` references (or support both). |
| **Agent Definitions** | 3-4 days | Map PAI agent types to OpenCode modes. Translate Task tool patterns to subagent invocations. |
| **Skills Discovery** | 4-6 days | Replace auto-loading triggers with skill tool integration. Maintain backward compatibility. |
| **MCP Configuration** | 2-3 days | Translate `.claude/.mcp.json` to embedded `opencode.json` format. |
| **Custom Commands** | 2-3 days | Move from `.claude/commands/` to `.opencode/command/`, adapt to dynamic prompt features. |
| **Permissions** | 3-4 days | Map custom permission checks to OpenCode's native system. |
| **Tool Registration** | 3-5 days | Convert PAI tool patterns to OpenCode TypeScript tool format. |
| **Session Handling** | 3-4 days | Adapt history system to work with OpenCode's SQLite vs JSONL. |

**Subtotal:** ~25-37 days

### What Needs Complete Rewrite

❌ **Fundamentally Incompatible (50-100% rewrite)**

| Component | Effort | Reason |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **Hook System** | 10-14 days | PAI: 4 TypeScript hooks. OpenCode: 30+ plugin events with different architecture. Need complete redesign. |
| **SessionStart Logic** | 5-7 days | PAI loads CORE context via hook. OpenCode needs plugin-based initialization or config-based rules. |
| **PostToolUse Tracking** | 4-6 days | PAI captures tool outputs to history. OpenCode uses `tool.execute.after` plugin hook with different payload. |
| **Voice Feedback Integration** | 5-7 days | PAI uses Stop hook + COMPLETED line. OpenCode needs custom plugin listening to `session.idle` event. |
| **Agent Delegation Logic** | 7-10 days | PAI uses Task tool with model selection. OpenCode uses @ mentions and subagent system. Routing logic incompatible. |
| **Session Summary Generation** | 3-5 days | PAI uses SessionEnd hook. OpenCode needs `session.idle` plugin implementation. |

**Subtotal:** ~34-49 days

**Total Estimated Migration Effort:** **59-86 days** (excluding unknowns)

---

## 4. Critical Gaps Identified

### From Audit Document

1. **Plugin System Research Gaps** (CRITICAL)
   - OpenCode plugin docs have "TODO" sections with unanswered questions:
     - How to block tool execution in `onPreToolCall` hook?
     - How to inject context at session start programmatically?
     - Tab title update mechanisms in plugins?
     - Observability integration patterns?
   - **Risk:** Attempting hook migration without these answers will cause implementation failures
   - **Mitigation:** Must research actual plugin source code or test implementations before v1.2

2. **Error Handling Not Documented**
   - What happens when LLM call fails?
   - Tool execution failure recovery?
   - Session storage corruption handling?
   - Network error retry strategies?
   - **Risk:** Production issues during migration
   - **Mitigation:** Must implement comprehensive error handling based on testing

3. **Migration Guide Missing**
   - No official "Migrating from Claude Code to OpenCode" documentation
   - **Risk:** Team lacks clear migration path
   - **Mitigation:** Must create comprehensive migration guide as part of v1.1

4. **Security Model Not Fully Specified**
   - Permission system security model unclear
   - Prompt injection prevention patterns not documented
   - Secret management recommendations sparse
   - **Risk:** Security vulnerabilities during migration
   - **Mitigation:** Must define security architecture before production use

### From DeepWiki Research

5. **Event Payload Schemas Not Fully Documented**
   - Plugin hooks mentioned with 30+ event types, but exact signatures missing
   - Need to inspect OpenAPI spec or SDK source for complete details
   - **Risk:** Plugin development blocked without payload structures
   - **Mitigation:** Research SDK types or test implementations

6. **Performance Characteristics Unknown**
   - Context window management strategy not detailed
   - Token counting methodology unclear
   - Session compaction algorithm not specified
   - **Risk:** Unexpected bottlenecks or cost overruns
   - **Mitigation:** Performance testing during migration

### From PAI Packs Audit

7. **Bun Runtime Dependency Throughout PAI**
   - PAI packs use `Bun.stdin.text()`, `Bun.spawn()`, Bun-specific APIs
   - OpenCode documentation doesn't specify runtime (though it's also Bun-based)
   - **Risk:** Runtime compatibility issues
   - **Mitigation:** Create Bun/Node.js compatibility layer

8. **Environment Variable Assumptions**
   - PAI uses `CLAUDE_CODE_AGENT`, `$PAI_DIR`, etc.
   - OpenCode uses `OPENCODE_CONFIG`, different conventions
   - **Risk:** Scripts break due to missing env vars
   - **Mitigation:** Environment variable mapping layer

### Additional Gaps

9. **History System Preservation**
   - PAI's comprehensive history system (learnings, research, decisions, sessions) is unique
   - OpenCode has basic export/import but not equivalent organizational structure
   - **Risk:** Loss of knowledge capture system
   - **Mitigation:** Preserve PAI history system alongside OpenCode

10. **SpecFirst Workflow Compatibility**
    - PAI's SpecFirst workflow is central to development methodology
    - OpenCode has no equivalent
    - **Risk:** Core PAI feature lost
    - **Mitigation:** Preserve SpecFirst as PAI-specific layer

| **Hook translation breaks voice feedback** | Medium | High | Preserve existing hook system in parallel during transition. Thorough testing. |
| **Skills don't auto-load** | Medium | High | Implement auto-registration wrapper. Maintain USE WHEN trigger compatibility. |
| **Agent delegation patterns incompatible** | High | Critical | Design compatibility layer. Map Task tool API to OpenCode subagents. Test thoroughly. |
| **Session history data loss** | Low | Critical | Preserve PAI history system. Don't migrate to OpenCode's export/import. Backup everything. |
| **Configuration migration breaks existing setups** | Medium | Medium | Support both formats. Provide converter tool. Clear migration guide. Rollback plan. |
| **Performance degradation** | Low | Medium | Benchmark during migration. Monitor token usage. Optimize as needed. |
| **User confusion during transition** | High | Medium | Clear communication. Gradual rollout. Comprehensive documentation. Support channel. |
| **Lost PAI unique features** | Medium | High | Explicitly preserve SpecFirst, History, Voice. Don't force OpenCode patterns. |
| **Incomplete OpenCode documentation** | High | Medium | Plan for research time. Test actual behavior. Contribute findings back. |
| **Breaking changes in OpenCode** | Medium | Medium | Pin OpenCode version. Monitor releases. Test upgrades before rolling out. |
| **Bun runtime compatibility** | Low | Medium | Create runtime abstraction. Test on Node.js if needed. Document requirements. |
| **MCP configuration translation errors** | Medium | Low | Automated converter with validation. Test all MCP integrations. Manual review. |
| **Permission system gaps** | Low | Medium | Map PAI security patterns to OpenCode. Validate all permission checks. Security audit. |

### Critical Path Items

**Blockers for v1.1:**
1. Configuration converter must work reliably
2. Skill discovery must preserve functionality
3. Agent delegation must not regress
4. CORE skill must auto-load

**Blockers for v1.2:**
1. Plugin research must answer open questions
2. Hook translation must preserve voice feedback
3. History system must remain intact
4. Session summaries must still generate

**Risk Mitigation Strategy:**
- Phase migrations with rollback points
- Maintain Claude Code compatibility during transition
- Comprehensive testing at each phase
- User communication and documentation
- Fallback to Claude Code if critical issues arise
