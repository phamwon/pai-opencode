## 1. Voice Server (TTS Notifications) ✅ INCLUDED IN v1.1

**Status:** ✅ Included in v1.1
**Priority:** P1 (High)

### What It Does

The Voice Server provides **text-to-speech notifications** for:
- Task completion alerts
- Error notifications
- Session milestone announcements
- Long-running command completion

### Implementation (v1.1)

The voice server is now included in `.opencode/voice-server/`:

```bash
# Start the voice server
cd .opencode/voice-server && bun run server.ts
```

**Supported TTS Providers:**
1. **ElevenLabs** (default) - High-quality voices, requires API key
2. **Google Cloud TTS** - Alternative, requires API key
3. **macOS `say`** - Free fallback, built-in

See `.opencode/voice-server/README.md` for setup details.

## 2. Observability Dashboard

**Status:** Deferred to v1.2
**Priority:** P2 (Medium)

### What It Does

The Observability Dashboard provides **real-time monitoring** of:
- Active sessions
- Tool usage metrics
- Security events
- Learning capture
- Agent invocations

![Observability Dashboard](images/observability-dashboard.png)

### Why Deferred

- Vue + Vite build system needs OpenCode testing
- Event capture requires plugin `tool.execute.after` testing
- Real-time SSE needs validation

### Workaround (v1.1)

View events manually:
```bash
cat .opencode/MEMORY/raw-outputs/2026-*/*.jsonl | jq
```

---

## 3. Auto-Migration

**Status:** Deferred to v1.x
**Priority:** P3 (Low)

### What It Does

Auto-Migration provides **automatic updates** from Claude Code PAI:
- Detects new PAI 2.x releases
- Pulls upstream changes
- Applies to OpenCode installation
- Preserves USER customizations

### Why Deferred

- Need stable v1.1 baseline first
- Upstream detection requires GitHub API
- Migration strategies need per-component logic

### Workaround (v1.1)

Manual migration using converter:
```bash
bun Tools/pai-to-opencode-converter.ts \
  --source vendor/PAI/Releases/v2.x \
  --target .opencode \
  --mode selective
```

---

## 4. MCP Server Adapters

**Status:** Deferred to v1.x
**Priority:** P3 (Low)

### What It Does

MCP Server Adapters provide **external tool integration**:
- **deepwiki-enhanced**: GitHub repo Q&A via Devin API
- **Community MCP servers**: Various integrations from the MCP ecosystem

### Why Deferred

- OpenCode MCP server support needs testing
- MCP protocol compatibility unknown
- Authentication needs secure handling

### Workaround (v1.1)

Use external tools directly or via web interfaces.

## Contributing

Want to help implement deferred features?

1. **Check GitHub Issues** for feature discussions
2. **Read technical docs** for architecture details
3. **Start with tests** - verify OpenCode compatibility first
4. **Submit PRs** with tests and documentation

**Priority order:**
1. Observability (v1.2) - High value, moderate complexity
2. Auto-Migration (v1.x) - Complex, needs stable baseline
3. MCP Adapters (v1.x) - Experimental
