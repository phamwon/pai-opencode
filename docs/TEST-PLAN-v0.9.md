# PAI-OpenCode v0.9 Integration Test Plan

**Date:** 2026-01-19
**Tester:** Steffen
**Environment:** Fresh OpenCode session with PAI-OpenCode
**Session Time:** 00:56 - 01:40 PST

---

## Pre-Test Setup

```bash
cd /Users/steffen/workspace/github.com/Steffen025/pai-opencode
opencode
```

**Pre-test fix required:** Converter had to be run with vanilla PAI source:
```bash
# Update upstream PAI
cd vendor/PAI && git pull origin main

# Run converter with vanilla source (not ~/.claude which is Jeremy)
bun run tools/pai-to-opencode-converter.ts --source vendor/PAI/Releases/v2.3/.claude --target .opencode
```

## Test Execution Log

### Test 1.1 - CORE loads on session start
**Time:** 01:00
**Result:** ⚠️ PARTIAL PASS
**Notes:** CORE loads and AI identifies as PAI. However, it searches for `settings.json` instead of `opencode.json`. The CORE skill still references Claude Code paths.

### Test 1.2 - USE WHEN trigger - CreateSkill
**Time:** 01:02
**Result:** ✅ PASS
**Notes:** Typing "Ich möchte einen neuen Skill erstellen" correctly activated CreateSkill. The skill was loaded from `.opencode/skill/CreateSkill/`.

### Test 1.3 - USE WHEN trigger - explicit
**Time:** 01:05
**Result:** ❌ FAIL
**Notes:** `/CreateSkill` slash command does not exist in OpenCode. This is a Claude Code feature that doesn't translate to OpenCode. Skills are activated via USE WHEN triggers or `mcp_skill` tool, not slash commands.

### Test 1.4 - Progressive disclosure
**Time:** 01:10
**Result:** ⚠️ PARTIAL PASS
**Notes:**
- All 20 skills loaded: ~44,500 tokens
- Fresh session (CORE only): ~31,000 tokens (15% of context)
- Savings: ~13,500 tokens (30%)
- CORE is intentionally large in PAI 2.3 design

### Test 2.1 - Agent visible in picker
**Time:** 01:15
**Result:** ✅ PASS
**Notes:** `/agents` shows 13 agents from vanilla PAI 2.3 (more than Jeremy's 4 custom agents). All converted agents visible: Architect, Designer, Engineer, Intern, QATester, Pentester, Artist, ClaudeResearcher, GeminiResearcher, GrokResearcher, CodexResearcher, researcher, writer.

### Test 2.2 - Single agent delegation
**Time:** 01:18 (original), 01:45 (retest after v0.9 fix)
**Result:** ✅ PASS (after v0.9 fix)
**Notes:**
- Original: `@intern` threw `ProviderModelNotFoundError` due to `model: opus`
- **Retest (v0.9):** `@Intern Recherchiere was ist TypeScript` worked flawlessly
- Agent completed comprehensive research including TypeScript history, features, and adoption stats
- No model errors, proper haiku model used

### Test 2.3 - Parallel agents
**Time:** 01:20 (skipped), 01:45 (tested after v0.9 fix)
**Result:** ✅ PASS (after v0.9 fix)
**Notes:**
- Original: Skipped due to agent model configuration issues
- **Retest (v0.9):** `@Intern Recherchiere TypeScript und @Engineer Erkläre die Vorteile`
- Both agents ran in parallel successfully
- Intern: Researched TypeScript (7 tool calls, webfetch)
- Engineer: Explained practical advantages with ROI calculations
- Both completed independently with proper outputs

### Test 2.4 - Agent model correct
**Time:** 01:20 (original), 01:45 (verified after v0.9 fix)
**Result:** ✅ PASS (after v0.9 fix)
**Notes:**
- Original: Agent files had `model: opus` instead of `anthropic/claude-opus-4-5`
- **After v0.9 fix:** All 13 agent files have correct format:
  - `intern.md` → `anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5` (cost-effective for grunt work)
  - All others → `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5` (balanced for implementation)
- Verified via `grep "^model:" .opencode/agent/*.md`

### Test 3.1 - Plugin loads
**Time:** 01:22
**Result:** ✅ PASS
**Notes:** Plugin loads successfully. Log file at `/tmp/pai-opencode-debug.log` shows:
```
[INFO ] === PAI-OpenCode Plugin Loaded ===
```

### Test 3.2 - Context injection
**Time:** 01:23
**Result:** ✅ PASS
**Notes:** Context injection working. Log shows multiple:
```
[INFO ] Context injected successfully
```

### Test 3.3 - Security blocking
**Time:** 01:25
**Result:** ✅ PASS
**Notes:** Dangerous command `rm -rf ../test` was blocked:
```
Error: [PAI Security] This command has been blocked for security reasons.
It matches a known dangerous pattern.
```
AI provided safe alternatives.

### Test 3.4 - Logging works
**Time:** 01:26
**Result:** ✅ PASS
**Notes:** All events logged to `/tmp/pai-opencode-debug.log`:
- session.created, session.updated, session.idle
- message.updated, message.part.updated
- Tool lifecycle events

### Test 4.1 - Help works
**Time:** 01:28
**Result:** ✅ PASS
**Notes:** `--help` displays complete usage information with options, examples, and conversion details.

### Test 4.2 - Dry-run works
**Time:** 01:14 (during pre-test setup)
**Result:** ✅ PASS
**Notes:** Dry-run showed 767 files would be converted without making changes.

### Test 4.3 - Files converted
**Time:** 01:14 (during pre-test setup)
**Result:** ✅ PASS
**Notes:** Converter successfully created 20 skills in `.opencode/skill/`:
Agents, AnnualReports, Art, BrightData, Browser, CORE, Council, CreateCLI, CreateSkill, FirstPrinciples, OSINT, PAIUpgrade, PrivateInvestigator, Prompting, Recon, RedTeam, Research, System, Telos, THEALGORITHM

### Test 5.1 - OpenCode startup
**Time:** 01:00
**Result:** ✅ PASS
**Notes:** OpenCode starts without errors. TUI loads correctly.

### Test 5.2 - Session persistence
**Time:** 01:35
**Result:** ✅ PASS
**Notes:** Sessions persist across restarts. Session list shows all previous sessions with timestamps. Can switch between sessions using history picker.

### Test 5.3 - No TUI corruption
**Time:** 01:38
**Result:** ✅ PASS
**Notes:** TUI remained stable throughout entire test session. No flickering, no garbled text, no freezing.

## Appendix: Fixed Issues in v0.9.0

### Issue 1: Agent Model Format ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** Converter outputs `model: opus` but OpenCode expects `model: anthropic/claude-opus-4-5`

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Added `MODEL_MAPPING` and `getModelForAgent()` to converter
2. Cost-aware model assignment:
   - `intern`, `explore` → `anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5` (fast, cheap)
   - All other agents → `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5` (balanced)
3. Fixed all 13 existing agent files manually

### Issue 2: Slash Commands (Documented)

**Problem:** `/SkillName` works in Claude Code but not OpenCode

**Resolution:** Documented behavior difference - OpenCode uses `USE WHEN` triggers in skill descriptions.

### Issue 3: CORE Path References ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** CORE skill references `settings.json` instead of `opencode.json`

**Solution:** Updated CORE SKILL.md Configuration section to reference `opencode.json` and explain OpenCode config structure.

### Issue 4: ~/.claude Collision (Documented)

**Problem:** On machines with both Jeremy (Claude Code) and PAI-OpenCode, OpenCode may scan ~/.claude first.

**Resolution:** Document as known behavior. Not an issue for vanilla installations.
