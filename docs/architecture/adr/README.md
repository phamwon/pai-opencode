# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

**Purpose:** Document key architectural decisions made when porting PAI v2.4 to OpenCode.

---

## What Are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records document **WHY** we made specific technical choices during the port. They explain:
- The context/problem we faced
- What we decided to do
- Why we chose that option
- What alternatives we considered
- What trade-offs we accepted

**Target Audience:**
- Contributors wanting to understand design rationale
- Users curious about port decisions
- Future maintainers (including future us!)
- Anyone porting PAI to another platform

---

## Decision

---

## Rationale
[WHY did we choose this option?]

---

## Alternatives Considered
### 1. [Alternative Name]
**Rejected** because: [reasons]

## Future ADRs

Potential topics for future documentation:

| Topic | Why It Matters |
|-------|----------------|
| Voice Server Implementation | When adding in v1.1 |
| Observability Dashboard Port | When adding in v1.2 |
| Model Name Mapping Strategy | If changing provider system |
| Agent Type Mapping | If OpenCode adds native agents |
| Memory System Evolution | If changing from file-based |

## Contributing ADRs

**When to create an ADR:**
- You're making a significant architectural choice
- Future contributors will ask "why did we do it this way?"
- There were trade-offs or alternatives worth documenting
- The decision affects multiple components or users

**When NOT to create an ADR:**
- Routine bug fixes (not architectural)
- Obvious/standard choices (no alternatives considered)
- Temporary decisions (will be replaced soon)

**Process:**
1. Copy template above
2. Fill in all sections (especially Alternatives and Consequences)
3. Get feedback from maintainers
4. Merge and update this README index

## Questions?

- **"Why isn't X decision documented?"** - Might be obvious, routine, or we missed it! Open an issue.
- **"Can I propose changing an Accepted ADR?"** - Yes! Create a new ADR that supersedes it.
- **"How do ADRs relate to MIGRATION.md?"** - ADRs explain WHY, MIGRATION.md explains HOW.
